# Front-end Helpers

Sass files, CSS classes and JS modules I commonly use for building front-end applications and UIs. These are not intended to be looked at as a "kit" or "framework", but a collection of helpers and modifiers that can be added on top of an existing project, or work along side an existing CSS framework to provide utility classes and modifier for speeding up the development of custom front-end layouts. Included are classes for working with flexbox, grid-layouts, animations, typography, images, inputs, controls and other common utils.
